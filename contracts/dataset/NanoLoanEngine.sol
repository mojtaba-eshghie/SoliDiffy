        Realizes a payment of a given Loan, before performing the payment the accumulated
        interest is computed and added to the total pending amount.

        Before calling this function, the msg.sender must call the "approve" function on the RCN Token, specifying an amount
        sufficient enough to pay the equivalent of the desired payment and the oracle fee.

        Because it is difficult or even impossible to know in advance how much RCN are going to be spent on the
        transaction*, we recommend performing the "approve" using an amount 5% superior to the wallet estimated
        spending. If the RCN spent results to be less, the extra tokens are never debited from the msg.sender.

        * The RCN rate can fluctuate on the same block, and it is impossible to know in advance the exact time of the
        confirmation of the transaction. 

        If the paid pending amount equals zero, the loan changes status to "paid" and it is considered closed.
