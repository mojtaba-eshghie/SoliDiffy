 * elliptic curve primitives and hashes.
 * Calling this internally from another function will lead to memory mutation and undefined behaviour.
 * The intended use case is to call this externally via `staticcall`.
 * External calls to OptimizedAZTEC can be treated as pure functions as this contract contains no
 * storage and makes no external calls (other than to precompiles)
