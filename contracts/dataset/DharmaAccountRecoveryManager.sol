 * @title DharmaAccountRecoveryManager
 * @author 0age
 * @notice This contract will be owned by DharmaAccountRecoveryMultisig and will
 * manage resets to the user's signing key. It implements a set of timelocked
 * functions, where the `setTimelock` function must first be called, with the
 * same arguments that the function will be supplied with. Then, a given time
 * interval must first fully transpire before the timelock functions can be
 * successfully called.
 *
 * The timelocked functions currently implemented include:
 *  recover(address wallet, address newUserSigningKey)
 *  modifyTimelockInterval(bytes4 functionSelector, uint256 newTimelockInterval)
 *
 * Note that special care should be taken to differentiate between lost keys and
 * compromised keys, and that the danger of a user being impersonated is
 * extremely high. Account recovery should progress to a system where the user
 * builds their preferred account recovery procedure into a "key ring" smart
 * contract at their signing address, reserving this "hard reset" for extremely
 * unusual circumstances and eventually sunsetting it entirely.
